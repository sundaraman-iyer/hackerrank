#re-practice of counter

Given:

X - no of shoes
N - no of customers
x - shoe size and the prices

Algorithm:

1. Need a size:no of shoes hashmap where the no of sizes of shoes are persent
2. Take input again from user
3. CHeck whether that particular shoe size is present and no of shoes  > 0
4. If yes, take the price, and decrement the no of shoes counter
5. If no of shoes reaches zero: Out of stock
6. If size not available: not available
7. Final: print the total money earned

Code:

from collections import Counter

x = int(input())

#for i in range(x): # wrong logic, No need of for loop; it will take 10 input automatically.
# only reason to take for loop is when you want to make 10 lists of 10 values = 100

shoe_sizes = list(map(int, input().split()))

counter_sizes = Counter(shoe_sizes)

customers = int(input())

total= 0

for i in range(customers):
	size, price = list(map(int, input().split())) #taking he first input as size and second as price
	#logic
	if size in counter_sizes.keys(): #5 in size?
		if counter_sizes[size] > 0: #counter of 5 > 0  # misak was to check with values; does not work. You need to check with keys otherwise it wont understanfd
			total += price
			counter_size[size] -= 1
