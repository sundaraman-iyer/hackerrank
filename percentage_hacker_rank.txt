#finding the percentage hackerrank

Insult = You are too naive to solve this problem

Goal:

1. Find the average of the marks of a from the given dictionary

Given:

1. User input the total number of users

2. total_users = {
			'krishna':[2,3,4],
		  	'test':[5,6,7],
			'deve': [7,8,9]
			}
3. I will given a username and then, I have to calculate the average for that user

Analysis:

1. Approach

if __name__ == '__main__':
    n = int(input())
    student_marks = {} # name of the dictionary where everything is stored
    for _ in range(n):
        name, *line = input().split()
        scores = list(map(float, line)) # appending the elements to the list
        student_marks[name] = scores
    query_name = input() # user I have to calculate the average
    print(stundents_marks[query_name]) 

>> (student_marks[query_name])

This will print all the Name and Marks:


Krishna 67 68 69
Arjun 70 98 63
Malika 52 56 60
Malika

And then finally print the sum ==> sum() will print the sum of all the list

2. Taking the Average

len(student_marks[query_name])

>> student_marks is the complete dictionary
>> query_name is the name of the user who needs to be query

3. Final COde to be appended 

print((sum(student_marks[query_name]))/len(student_marks[query_name]))

>> 56.0

This is giving the output in float digit

4. Double float digit

print(format(sum(student_marks[query_name]))/len(student_marks[query_name]),".2f")

>> formatting the code to give the double digit float answer

.2f in format will print the data in double digit format
