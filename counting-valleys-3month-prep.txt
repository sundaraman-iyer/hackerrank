#hackerrank Counting Valleys

Given:

U- Uphill
D- Downhill

Each step 1 unit change in Altitude

We define the following terms:

- A mountain is a sequence of consecutive steps above sea level, starting with a step up from sea level and ending with a step down to sea level.

- A valley is a sequence of consecutive steps below sea level, starting with a step down from sea level and ending with a step up to sea level.

Given the sequence of up and down steps during a hike, find and print the number of valleys walked through. 

My confusion:

DD - Valley

UU - Mountain

U - 1 climb
D- 1 Drop


UDDDUDUU
10001011

Solution:

U = +1
D = -1

if sea_level_counter == 0 and step == 'U':
	valley_counter +=1


Logic:

def countingValleys(steps, path):
    # Write your code here
    sea_level_counter = valley_counter = 0

    
    for i in path:
        if i == 'U':
            sea_level_counter +=1
        else:
            sea_level_counter -=1
    
        if sea_level_counter == 0 and i == 'U':
            valley_counter +=1
        
    return valley_counter
		
	return valley_counter
