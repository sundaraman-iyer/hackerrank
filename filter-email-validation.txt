#hackerrank validating email address through filter

Given:

email list is being taken from the user

I need to write a function which will validate the email from the list 

And print it in the lexicographical order

Solution:

1. Import regular expression

Eg: username@websitename.extension

re.search(r"^[\w,-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9]+\.[a-zA-Z]{1,3}$", s)


^ = start of the string
\w = Covers a-z, A-Z and 0 to 9 along with under score _ 
However, - (minus) is not covered
- = To check for minus
+ = To check for 1+ occurance
@ = To check for @ symbol
[a-zA-Z0-9] = Checking for characters
\. = for checking period
+ = To check for 1+ occurance
{1,3} = Max length of extention can be 3 i.e allowed between 1 to 3
$ = Stop the search


Final Code:

import re

def fun(s):
    if (re.search("^[\w,-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9]+\.[a-zA-Z]{1,3}$", s)):
        return True
    else:
        return False
    

def filter_mail(emails):
    return list(filter(fun, emails))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    n = int(input())
    emails = []
    for _ in range(n):
        emails.append(input())

filtered_emails = filter_mail(emails)
filtered_emails.sort()
print(filtered_emails)
