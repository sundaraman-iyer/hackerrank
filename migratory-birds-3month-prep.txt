If we find a value in the orginal array

then we increment the dummy array with the index of that value


for example:

[1,1,3,4,3,4,1,2,3]

[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]


for loop
[1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]

#2 iteration

[2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]

#3 iteration

[2,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]

What we want is that, we need to increment the index of the dummy array with tindex value of the orginal array

Code:

dummy_list = [0]*len(arr)

for i in arr:
	#we need to use the element in the orginal array as the index to increment the value in the dummy array by 1
	dummy[i-1] +=1 #why -1? because in this challenge we are starting index with 1
return dummy.index(max(dummy)) +1 # adding +1 at the end to resolve the 1st indexing
