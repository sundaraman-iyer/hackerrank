#hackerrank reduce function

Given:

reduce(): reduce(fun,seq) function is used to apply a particular function passed in its argument to all of the list elements mentioned in the sequence passed along.

You need to import from functools

Return type: 1 single element

Solution:

A. Using reduce

t = reduce(lambda x, y : x * y,fracs)

o/p:
5/8

However, we need output in 5 8

B. For that the code already has Fractions imported

t = Fraction(reduce(lambda x, y : x * y,fracs))

O/p:

5 8
