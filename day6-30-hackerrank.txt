#hackerrank day 6 code challenge: Let's review

Given:

S = string
N = length, index starts from 0

Goal:

Print its even and odd indexed characters 
As 2 space separated strings 

Solution:

1. We need a variable to keep a track of even and odd index characters

t = int(input())


even = []
odd = []

for _ in range (t):
    s= input() # placing input here because I need two input string from the user
    for i in range (len(s)):
        if i%2 == 0:
            even +=[s[i]]
        else:
            odd +=[s[i]]

print(even, odd)

# o/p:

What I am getting the output ['H', 'c', 'e', 'R', 'n'] ['a', 'k', 'r', 'a', 'k']

The code here is taking both the string input available in the code

And adding them to the same list, however, the code should be take both the input 

And add them to seperate list


Corrected code:

t = int(input())
for _ in range (t):
    s = input()
    even = '' #initiate an empty variable
    odd = '' # initiate an empty variable
    
    for i in range (len(s)):
        if i%2 == 0:
            even +=s[i]
        else:
            odd +=s[i]

    print('{} {}'.format(even, odd))
