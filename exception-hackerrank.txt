#hackerrank exception solution

Given:

1. First line T integer inputs of test cases
2. Second line T, input seperate by space a and b

Goal:

1. Raise Exception and print it

Solution:

n = int(input())

x,y = input().split() # ask inside for loop since, you need to take 3 values

try:
	print x//y # 3//2 o/p: 1; 1//2 o/p: 0 

except (ValueError, ZeroDivisionError) as e:
	print("Error Code:",e)

Corrected Code:

n = int(input())

for i in range(n):
    try:
        x, y = input().split()
        print(int(x)//int(y))
    except ZeroDivisionError as e:
        print("Error Code:",e)
    except ValueError as v:
        print("Error Code:",v)
