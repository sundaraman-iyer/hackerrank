#itertools combinations hackerrank solution

return type: memory location, then list of tuples

Given:

1. string and int

Goal:

Print lexicographic sorted order combination of string

Solution:

1. from itertools import combinations

s, k = input().split()
k = int(k)

for i in range (1,k+1): # loop for creating the iterating till user mentioned length eg. 3
    for j in combinations(sorted(s),i): # loop for creating the sorted combinations upto user mentioned len
        print(j)

# o/p:

    ('A',)

    ('C',)

    ('H',)

    ('K',)

    ('A', 'C')

    ('A', 'H')

    ('A', 'K')

    ('C', 'H')

    ('C', 'K')

    ('H', 'K')

2. All that I have to do is join

Join can iterate through a tuple, list, dict, set and join based on space or any delimiter

from itertools import combinations

s, k = input().split()
k = int(k)

for i in range (1,k+1): # loop for creating the iterating till user mentioned length eg. 3
    for j in combinations(sorted(s),i): # loop for creating the sorted combinations upto user mentioned len
        print(''.join(j))
