#max-permiter-triangle


Given:

1. Choose the one with the longest maximum side. 
2. If more than one has that maximum, choose from them the one with the longest minimum side.
3. If more than one has that maximum as well, print any one them.

If non-degenerate triangle exist [-1]

Understand the problem

Degenerate Triangle: x+y<= third side

Non-Degenerate Triangle: Whatever pair fulfils the condition x+y<= third side - Ignore that pair

Soln:

def maxPeri(sticks):
	sticks.sort()
	i = len(sticks) - 3 # bcz, we have to traverse from last and check for the3rd last number and from there we can check for second last check for last as well
	while i>=0 and sticks[i]+sticks[i+1] <= sticks[i+2]:
		i-=1 # going to previous element for the next iteration
	
	if i>=0:
		return [sticks[i], sticks[i+1], sticks[i+2]]
	else:
		return [-1]
