#day 29 Bitwise AND

BitwiseAND operator: Bitwise AND operator Returns 1 if both the bits are 1 else 0.

Given:

2 Inputs: 

1st input is the no.of test cases
2nd input is the no to covert 
3rd input is K i.e the max value

To find:

Max value of A BitwiseAND B within the limit

Logic

1. We need to initialize the max value = 0, for comparisoin
2. We will loop through the entire input using i till that raange
3. Inside the i for loop we will loop through the entire set using j
What this will do is: for every value of i, it will check with j and compare for the condition below
4. Now I have to do the bitwise "i & j"
5. Checking for the condition max < curr_bitwise < k:
6. If ues then max = curr_bitwise
7. return the max

Code:

def find(n,k):
	max_bitwise = 0

	for i in range(1,n+1):
		for j in range(1,i):
			curr_bitwise = i&j
			if max_bitwise < curr_bitwise < k:
				max_bitwise = curr_bitwise
	return max_bitwise
