Given:

s = SOSSOT

sos = SOS

pair_sos = len(s) // len(sos)

SOT !== SOS
if str[0] !== sos[0]
	counter +=1
elif str[1] !== sos[1]
	counter +=1
else: str[2] !== sos[0]
	counter +=1



My logic was half right, the iteration part

What I missed out was the ZIP function which will check 

For the individual characters

Final Code:

s = input()

count = 0

r = len(s)//3

target_string = "SOS"*r # for getting the target strings

for i, j in zip(target_string, s): // for checking each character with each other
	if i !=j:
		count +=1

return count
