Given:

n = no of towers
m = initial height of tower
The player chooses a tower of height x and reduces to y

i.e:

x = current height of the tower
y = new height of the tower

How to Play:

Reduce size of the tower such that the new height y is divisible by current height x

Note:

Towers can be reduced to any height upto 1 (since all numbers are divisble by 1)

End Goal to win the game:

You cannot let the other player make their turn

Meaning: You have to reduce the tower height to 1. Hence no more moves

Logic:

When the no.of towers = 1: Player 1 always wins
When the height = 1: Player 2 always wins

When even towers, Player 1 loses
When odd towers, Player 2 loses

Psuedo Code:

if m == 1 or n%2 == 0:
	return 2
else:
	return 1
