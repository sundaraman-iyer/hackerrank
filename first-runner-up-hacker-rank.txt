#hackerrank first runnerup solution

Goal:

1. Find the runner up from the score sheet.

Given:

1. Data will be stored in a list

2. No.of scores =  n

3. First i/p is the total no.of scores

4. Second i/p contains array - why? Bcz Array's can be used to perform mathematical operations

5. 2 <= n <= 10 and -100 <=A[i]<=100

Analysis:

1. Understand the concept

Runner means ==> n-1

2. Map function

a. First they are taking input from user and then splitting the input into space in between

3. Logic here:

a. I have a array

b. I will sort it into ascending

c. Then I will remove the duplicates

d. Then iterate through to second last: l[-2]

e. Let's check

Here's code:

def runner_up(arr):
    
    #converting the array to list and keeping the unique values
    
    arr = list(set(arr))
    #sorting the code
    arr.sort()
    #printing the last element
    print(arr[-2])



if __name__ == '__main__':
    n = int(input())
    arr = map(int, input().split())
    runner_up(arr)
