#day 23 Level Order Traversal

Also called as BFS

Given:

Node pointer root - Reference to the root

Output: Print node.data items as space-seperated line of integers.

No return value is expected

Logic:

		5
	3			9
2		4	7		10

1. Use a queue

first element = 5

Append = 5 to queue

Check for the element left and right

Pop 5 from Queue

Print("5")

Add left and right element

Meaning:

Iteration 1:

Queue = 5

Check left and right

add 3 and 9 to queue

Then pop 5

Print 5

Iteration 2:

Queue = 3, 9

Check for 3's left and right element

Append 2 and 4

Then pop 3

Queue = 9,2,4

And the iteration continues

Till the queue becomes empty completly

Code:

def levelOrder(root):
	q = [] #initializing an empty queue
	q.append(root)
	while len(q) !=0:
		root = q.pop(0)
		print(root.info, end= ' ') #printing the value of the queue
		if root.left is not None or root.right is not None:
			q.append(root.left)
			q.append(root.right)
