#minimum absolute difference 3month

Given:

1. Array will be given, you have to find the minimum differnce between 2 numbers

[2 -2 4]

|2-(-2)| = 4

Logic:

1. To find the minimum difference, all you have to understand is 

a. the difference between the highest and the second highest will be smallest

Hence, first sort the array

2. Min_val = Google(max int value in python), this will be where the number will be stored

3. Loop through every number and calc the diff

diff = abs(arr[i]-arr[i+1])

4. Compare the diff with min_value, if diff < min_value: min_value; else diff

5. return min_value

Code:

arr.sort()
min_val = 214783648

for i in range(len(arr)-1): #because, I want to start from zero and last will also be checked
	diff = abs(arr[i]-arr[i+1])
	if diff < min_val:
		min_val = diff
return min_val


Remember:

a. When You have to find the minimum difference: always take the max_value to compare
i.e Google max int value in python

Bcz you need to compare the curr_value with max_value to the min_value

if you assign 0, there can be -1 or even 0 at sometimes

Always remember this:

Find: min value

You need to compare it with the max int value in Python - Google

==>> And then constantly assign compare if curr_value < max_value: max_val=curr_val

b. When You have to ginf the maximum difference: always initial the value of min_value(the comparing value) = 0

Bcz you need to constantly compare the curr_diff > min_value: min_value == curr_diff

==>> To find: max_value; initial min_val = 0
To find: min_value; initial max_value = Google the max int value in python
