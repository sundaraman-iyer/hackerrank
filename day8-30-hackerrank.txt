#day 8 Dictionaries and maps

Given:

1. First line N contains the number of entries for the hashmap

Goal:

1. For the name in dict, print the phone number associated with it
2. If no name is found, print("Not found")

Corrected Code:

n = int(input())

d = {}

for i in range(0,n):
    name, number = input().split()
    d[name] = number
# since I am going to take 3 names for finding numbers all at the same time

while True:

    try:
        name = input()
        if name in d:
            print('{}={}'.format(name, d[name]))
        else:
            print("Not found")
    except EOFError:
        break
