n = total pages
p = target page no

To find:

1. Shortest path to the target from the first page or the last page such taht minimum pages are required

SOln:

formulae:

1. Going from Left to target:

(target_page//2)

2. Going from Right to target:

odd target_page_no:

(last_page-target_page)//2

even_target_page_no:
((lastpage+1)-target_page)//2

i.e change the last page_no from even to odd

Code:

l = p//2

n=n+1 if n%2==0 else n # if even change to odd else, keep n same

r = (n-p)//2

return min(l,r)
