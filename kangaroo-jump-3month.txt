#3month prep- number line jump

Given:

x1 = kangaroo1 start
v1 = jump of kang1
x2 = kangaroo2 start
v2 = jump of kang2

so if x1<x2 and v1 < v2:
	print No
elif if x1<x2 and v1 > v2:
	print Yes
else:
	print No

Stupid Dickhead:

The logic is built with the physic formula otherwise

It will take bruteforce method to check the solution

Get your head together

They are doing everything to relieve you of your duties

And here You are doing dick shit nothing

Get better on logic building and fundamental syntaxes

----

The solution is solving using the speed = dist/time

v = jumps/sec
x = start pos

So now the speed = dist/jumps

dis1 = (v1 * j) + x1
dis2 = (v2 * j) + x2

now to find the value of j:

x1 + (v1*j) = x2 + (v2*j)
x2-x1 = (v1-v2)*j
x2-x1/v1-v2 =j

==> Since, the kang can only make integer jumps i.e no float allowed

Hence, 

(x2-x1)%(v1-v2) = 0


Final Logic:

def kangaroo(x1, v1, x2, v2):
    # Write your code here
    
    if v2 > v1:
        return "NO"
    elif (x2-x1)%(v1-v2) == 0:
        return "YES"
    else:
        return "NO"
