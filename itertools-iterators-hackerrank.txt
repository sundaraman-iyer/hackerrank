#hackerrank iterables and iterators

Given:

1. N = list of lowercase english letters
2. k = int for index

I/p: 

1st line = len of list
2nd line = Characters separated by space
3rd line = Int K, denoting the number of indices to be selected

For this particular example consider, the index to be starting from 1

Goal:

Find the probability that K will be character 'a'

Solution:

1. Ask for len

length = int(input())

2. Ask for elements

char = list(input().split())

3. Indices to be taken

k = int(input())

4. To find the probability I have to create a pair of tuple based on the number given in k

if k == 2; make a pair of 2
k == 3; make a pair of 3

Hence for this very particular purpose, we will be using itertools because, it has the combinations module

combinations('ABCD', 2) >>> AB AC AD BC BD CD

So convert the combinations to a list

tup = list(combinations(l, k))

5. Create a counter and check for probability

count = 0

for i in tuples:
	if 'a' in tuples:
		count += 1
print(round(count/len(tuples)))
