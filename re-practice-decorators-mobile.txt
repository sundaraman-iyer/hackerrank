Output required: +91 xxxxx xxxxx

I/P:

['07895462130', '919875641230', '9195969878']

Algorithm:

1. According to the trick: Varying number at start, means start at eh end
2. Step 1: Loop through the list as per the user range
3. Take the first element and slice it from last upto 5 and conv to int
4. Now take the fist element and slice it from -5 to -10 and conv to int
5. Now I have two options: store in variable or in list
6. List is the better option bcz, the other function is going to unpack the code
7. Appending it to the list in the string format 
8. return the appended list

Optimized Code: No need to convert to int

def wrapper(func):
    def core_logic(l):
        res = []
        for i in range(len(l)):
            last = l[i][-5:]
            first = l[i][-10:-5]
            res.append("+91 " + first + " " + last)
        return func(res)
    return core_logic
